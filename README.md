# NeuralNetworks
This repository contains my projects with Neural Networks. I intend to regularly update this with new projects. Feel free to check out and suggest.

# NN from Scratch in Python
This folder contains NeuralNet.py which is the code file for the neural network. The file contains three classes:
1. Activation Functions: This contains a few standard activation functions and their derivatives.
2. NeuralNetwork_2HiddenLayers: This implements a Neural Network with two hidden layers.
3. NeuralNetwork_3HiddenLayers: This implements a Neural Network with three hidden layers.

Additonally, this folder also contains few datasets in csv format. The code file Datasetprocessing.py contains functions for respective datasets which return the target and training data.
To use, just clone this folder and run the file TrainMyNetwork.py. All NN parameters can be adjusted within this file according to the user.
To specify the dataset call in the respective function from Datasetprocessing.py.
